### WTR.sh | WindowMasker TRF RepeatMasker
The script runs the following repeat search programs WindowMasker, TRF and RepeatMasker alternately on the genome assembly. The resulting .gff files from each program are sorted and merged into a single .gff file. The genome assembly is then masked using the resulting merged .gff file.

### BWA.sh | Alignment
The script to perform alignments, with further plotting on heat maps.

### PAR.sh | Pseudoautosomal region
Computation of pseudoautosomal region coordinates.

### PSMC.sh | Population history
Script for population history reconstruction.

### CVC.sh | Correct Variant Calling
The script to perform correct genetic variant calling, with further plotting on heat maps and vaolin plots.

### SRA.sh
Downloading raw reads from NCBI.

### STK.sh
